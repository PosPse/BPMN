I want to extract activities from a business process text described in natural language and determine the relationship between two activities.

Below I give you a business process description text, in which the connecting words or phrases between activities are represented by [...] symbols.
"The credit company receives the credit information from the customer , If the requested amount is greater than 1M $ an approval must be requested . If the requested amount is lower or equal to 1M $ the company assess the risk of the credit . After the assessment , if the risk is high , an approval must be requested ; but if the risk is low the credit is accepted . After the approval request , the credit could be accepted or rejected ; [in both cases] , an email is sent to the customer .â€œ

##Task
Please determine the type of relationship represented by the word or phrase [in both cases] and the context in which it is located, and give an explanation. There are 4 types of relationships, as follows:
[sign-selection]: Indicates a selection relationship between activities.
[sign-successor]: indicates a direct sequential relationship between activities
[sign-parallel]: indicates a concurrent relationship between activities.
[sign-loop]: indicates a loop relationship between activities.

##Response
The results are output in JSON format, including "result" and "explain". The value of "result" is the relationship type. "explain" is the explanation of the result. You only need to output the results according to the format without outputting any redundant content.



Below is a text describing a business process. I will draw a flowchart based on this text.
The credit company receives the credit information from the customer , If the requested amount is greater than 1M $ an approval must be requested. If the requested amount is lower or equal to 1M $ the company assess the risk of the credit . If the requested amount is lower or equal to 1M $ the company assess the risk of the credit . After the assessment , if the risk is high , an approval must be requested ; but if the risk is low the credit is accepted . After the approval request , the credit could be accepted or rejected ; in both cases , an email is sent to the customer .

Below is the above business process text in the diagram for the node information:
0: The credit company receives the credit information from the customer
1: If
2: the requested amount is greater than 1M $
3: an approval must be requested
4: If
5: the requested amount is lower or equal to 1M $
6: the company assess the risk of the credit
7: After
8: the assessment
9: if
10: the risk is high
11: an approval must be requested
12: but if
13: the risk is low
14: the credit is accepted
15: After
16: the approval request
17: the credit could be accepted or rejected
18: in both cases
19: an email is sent to the customer

##Task
Determine whether node 1 and node 3 have directly connected edges based on the node information in the graph for the business process text and the service process text, and give a reason.

##Response
The result is output in JSON format, including two items: "result" and "explain". The value of "result" is 0 or 1. If there is a directly connected edge, it is 1, otherwise it is 0. "explain" is the explanation of the result. You only need to output the results according to the format, and there is no need to output any redundant content.
