Below is a text describing a business process. I will draw a flowchart based on this text.
The credit company receives the credit information from the customer , If the requested amount is greater than 1M $ an approval must be requested. If the requested amount is lower or equal to 1M $ the company assess the risk of the credit . If the requested amount is lower or equal to 1M $ the company assess the risk of the credit . After the assessment , if the risk is high , an approval must be requested ; but if the risk is low the credit is accepted . After the approval request , the credit could be accepted or rejected ; in both cases , an email is sent to the customer .

Below is the above business process text in the diagram for the node information:
0: The credit company receives the credit information from the customer
1: If
2: the requested amount is greater than 1M $
3: an approval must be requested
4: If
5: the requested amount is lower or equal to 1M $
6: the company assess the risk of the credit
7: After
8: the assessment
9: if
10: the risk is high
11: an approval must be requested
12: but if
13: the risk is low
14: the credit is accepted
15: After
16: the approval request
17: the credit could be accepted or rejected
18: in both cases
19: an email is sent to the customer

##Task
Determine whether node 1 and node 3 have directly connected edges based on the node information in the graph for the business process text and the service process text, and give a reason.

下面是一段描述业务流程的文字。我将根据这段文字绘制相应的流程图。
The credit company receives the credit information from the customer , If the requested amount is greater than 1M $  an approval must be requested. If the requested amount is lower or equal to 1M $ the company assess the risk of the credit . After the assessment , if the risk is high , an approval must be requested ; but if the risk is low the credit is accepted . After the approval request , the credit could be accepted or rejected ; in both cases , an email is sent to the customer .

下面是上述业务流程文本在图中对于的节点信息：
0: The credit company receives the credit information from the customer
1: If
2: the requested amount is greater than 1M $
3: an approval must be requested
4: If
5: the requested amount is lower or equal to 1M $
6: the company assess the risk of the credit
7: After
8: the assessment
9: if
10: the risk is high
11: an approval must be requested
12: but if
13: the risk is low
14: the credit is accepted
15: After
16: the approval request
17: the credit could be accepted or rejected
18: in both cases
19: an email is sent to the customer

##任务
根据业务流程文本和务流程文本在图中对于的节点信息判断节点1和节点3是否存在直接相连的边，并给出理由。
