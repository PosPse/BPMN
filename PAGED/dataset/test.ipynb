The same check is performed again to determine the incoming data. If it is a document or main data, it is stored. However, if it is a query, the document or main data is retrieved from local storage and forwarded, marking the end of the process. The storing of the document or main data also signifies the end of the process.\\n\\nFor Clients, the initial step involves converting the EPC and the secret key (or salt) into a numeric identifier using SHA-1. This numeric identifier is then sent as a query to the DHT. During the step of converting the EPC and secret key to a numeric identifier, it is important to note that the query is obfuscated. After sending the query, the client receives the document and/or main data. The received data object contains a version number, the name of the information provider, the hash of the EPC, the address of the EPCIS, and a signature (along with an optional certificate). The client then verifies the signature of the document and/or main data before sending a query to the EPCIS. The client receives a reply, marking the end of the process. It is worth mentioning that communication with the EPCIS is authenticated and encrypted by Transport Layer Security.\\n\\nFor Clients, if an event of a particular EPC is detected, the process continues. However, if a query is received from a client, the access is authorized. Simultaneously, the EPC and secret key (or salt) are converted into a numeric identifier using SHA-1, and the check is continued. During the step of authorizing access, specific EPCIS authentication or a shared key is used. It is important to note that the secret key is shared with trusted clients, and the salt is transported with the tag and used if no shared secret key is established. After authorizing access, a document is created and the main data is replied to the client. If the main data is stored in the information provider\\'s (EPCIS) repository, the process ends. Alternatively, if the main data is stored in the DHT (in addition to EPCIS), the process also ends. The main data is replied to the client, marking the end of the process. During the creation of the document, it is encrypted with a shared key. This step produces a data object containing a version number, the name of the information provider, the hash of the EPC, the address of the information provider (EPCIS), and a signature (along with an optional certificate). The document is then signed with a private key. It is important to note that the key is distributed to trusted clients through alternative secure channels.
