If it is a \"Publisher\", then the authentication process is initiated. On the other hand, if it is a \"Client\", the query, document, or main data is forwarded. The same check is performed again to determine the incoming data. If it is a document or main data, it is stored. However, if it is a query, the document or main data is retrieved from local storage and forwarded, marking the end of the process. The storing of the document or main data also signifies the end of the process.\n\nFor Clients, the initial step involves converting the EPC and the secret key (or salt) into a numeric identifier using SHA-1. This numeric identifier is then sent as a query to the DHT. During the step of converting the EPC and secret key to a numeric identifier, it is important to note that the query is obfuscated. After sending the query, the client receives the document and/or main data. The received data object contains a version number, the name of the information provider, the hash of the EPC, the address of the EPCIS, and a signature (along with an optional certificate). The client then verifies the signature of the document and/or main data before sending a query to the EPCIS. The client receives a reply, marking the end of the process. It is worth mentioning that communication with the EPCIS is authenticated and encrypted by Transport Layer Security.\n\nFor Clients, if an event of a particular EPC is detected, the process continues. However, if a query is received from a client, the access is authorized. Simultaneously, the EPC and secret key (or salt) are converted into a numeric identifier using SHA-1, and the check is continued. During the step of authorizing access, specific EPCIS authentication or a shared key is used. It is important to note that the secret key is shared with trusted clients, and the salt is transported with the tag and used if no shared secret key is established. After authorizing access, a document is created and the main data is replied to the client. If the main data is stored in the information provider's (EPCIS) repository, the process ends. Alternatively, if the main data is stored in the DHT (in addition to EPCIS), the process also ends. The main data is replied to the client, marking the end of the process. During the creation of the document, it is encrypted with a shared key. This step produces a data object containing a version number, the name of the information provider, the hash of the EPC, the address of the information provider (EPCIS), and a signature (along with an optional certificate). The document is then signed with a private key. It is important to note that the key is distributed to trusted clients through alternative secure channels. Finally, the document is published to the DHT, marking the end of the process. It is crucial to distinguish between the document as the discovery information and the main data as the detailed information in the step of publishing the document to the DHT."

During this time, you should also simultaneously complete the following steps: check process assign points and analyze the field to identify processes. After 4 days, the process model should be checked again. If the process assign points are correct, positive points should be assigned. Additionally, the field should be analyzed to identify processes and roles should be assigned within the team. The process should then be extended to L 2,3. Each team member should perform their assigned work according to their role. If it has been 1 week since the start of the project, the project progress should be checked. If a consultation is requested, the project should be consulted. If the project is accepted, it should be presented. If the project is not accepted, each team member should continue performing their assigned work. If the project is accepted, it should be presented and the process ends.

If the goods are not available, initiate the production process. Sending a decline message will result in the order being declined and the process ending. However, if the goods are available, continue with the process and send an order confirmation. Start the production and produce the article, then send the confirmation and prepare for delivery. Simultaneously, inform the stock and accounting department. Once the stock is informed, they will prepare the goods, and the accounting department will write the invoice. Once the goods are ready, deliver them to the customer, and send the invoice. Wait for payment to be made. If the customer has paid, close the order. If the quantity of reminders is greater than three, activate the donning process. Closing the order will result in the order being closed and the process ending. However, if the customer has not paid and the quantity of reminders is less than three, continue with the process.

If it is a \"Publisher\", then the authentication process is initiated. On the other hand, if it is a \"Client\", the query, document, or main data is forwarded. The same check is performed again to determine the incoming data. If it is a document or main data, it is stored. However, if it is a query, the document or main data is retrieved from local storage and forwarded, marking the end of the process. The storage of the document or main data also signifies the end of the process.\n\nFor EPCIS, the process starts by detecting an event of a particular EPC. If this condition is met, the process continues. Alternatively, if a query is received from a client, the access is authorized. Simultaneously, the EPC and the secret key (or salt) are converted to a numeric identifier using SHA-1. The authorization step requires specific EPCIS authentication or the shared key. Once authorized, the main data is replied to the client. If the main data is stored in the EPCIS repository, the process ends. However, if it is stored in the DHT, the process also ends. The conversion of the EPC and the secret key (or salt) to a numeric identifier using SHA-1 is followed by the creation of a document. It is important to note that the secret key is shared with trusted clients, and the salt is transported with the tag and used if no shared secret key was established. The process ends with the reply of the main data to the client. The creation of a document involves the inclusion of a version number, the name of the information provider, the hash of the EPC, the address of the EPCIS, and a signature (and an optional certificate). The document is then encrypted with a shared key and signed with a private key. The encryption key is distributed to trusted clients through alternative secure channels. The document is published to the DHT, with a distinction between the document as the discovery info and the main data as the detailed info. This marks the end of the process.\n\nFor Clients, the process begins by converting the EPC and the secret key (or salt) to a numeric identifier using SHA-1. This identifier is then sent as a query to the DHT. The query is obfuscated for security purposes. The client receives the document and/or the main data, followed by the verification of their authenticity. A query is then sent to the EPCIS, and the reply is received. It is important to note that communication with the EPCIS is authenticated and encrypted by Transport Layer Security. Finally, the process ends after receiving the reply."

Similarly, if the task involves \"Checking the database periodically for standing queries and newly published events\", then the process should also continue. Once the matched, pending standing query is executed, the results are returned to a standing query.

Additionally, the results should be secured via PKI and SOAP. Once the results are returned to a standing query, the process comes to an end. \n\nFor Clients: At the beginning, it is necessary to check if the client is already connected with a designated DS.

The next step involves authenticating the identity of the DS and receiving resource addresses URLs. The step of receiving resource addresses URLs produces a data object that states, \"The mailbox should be checked periodically.

For the SSP process, every hour the batch invoices are collected. The collected invoices are then sorted into clients and processed accordingly. After processing the invoice for the client, the \"invoice entered correctly\" box is checked and the invoice status is updated. For updating the invoice status, the SAP system is used. Once the invoice status is updated, a breakdown report is generated. When choosing the report method, if \"Archive per date\" is selected, the process continues. If \"Archive per vendor\" is selected, the process also continues, and then it comes to an end. At the end of the day, the invoice is sent back to the data entry inbox and then sent to the data entry officer, concluding the process. The step of sending the invoice back to the data entry inbox requires accessing the data object \"Batch data entry error\". To start the SSP process at the beginning of the month, the step is to delay invoice payment. Delaying invoice payment produces the data object \"completed invoices\", and then the process ends."

After explaining the solution, check if the Key Account Manager can handle any additional problems independently. If not, send an email to the support system. Otherwise, explain the solution again. Once an answer is received, explain the solution once more to conclude the process. For the 1st Level support agent, the process starts with the receipt of a ticket. Classify the ticket and then handle the 1st level issue. Document the 1st level result and the process ends. As for the 2nd level support agent, the process begins with the receipt of a ticket. Handle the 2nd level issue and check if there is any uncertainty. If there is no uncertainty, document the 2nd level result. However, if there is uncertainty, consult with a developer. Once the uncertainty is resolved, document the 2nd level result. For the Software Developer, the process starts with a request from support. Examine the problem and provide feedback for the 2nd level support. This concludes the process."

The step of checking the application form completeness also produces the \"Loan application\" data object. If the form is incomplete, the application should be returned back to the applicant. However, if the form is complete, the process can continue. In case of an incomplete form, the application is returned back to the applicant, and then the loan provider receives the updated application. Simultaneously, the loan provider needs to assess the loan risk and check the credit history. The assessment of loan risk requires accessing the \"Loan application\" data object and produces the \"Risk report\" data object. Similarly, checking the credit history requires accessing the \"Loan application\" data object and produces the \"Credit history report\" data object. After that, the loan provider needs to assess the eligibility. This step requires accessing the \"Risk report\" and \"Credit history report\" data objects, as well as the \"Loan application\" data object. It is important to note that eligible applications must have low risk and a sound credit history. If the applicant is not eligible, the application is rejected.

If there are still uncertainties, the Level-2 Staff checks again. Once the Level-1 Staff is confident in their resolution, they provide it to the client. If further research is required, the request is passed on to an employee for investigation. Once a resolution is developed, it undergoes testing. If the resolution is successful, the Level-1 Staff checks it again. If the request is fixed, the client's status in the database is changed to \"Closed\". However, if the request remains unresolved, the Level-2 Staff checks it once more. Finally, when the client's status is changed to \"Closed\" in the database, the process comes to an end."

In the master data entry department, they check if the invoice is urgent. If it is urgent, they create a new vendor master record within 24 hours. If it is not urgent, they create a new vendor master record. For the step of creating a new vendor master record, it is important to note that it takes 1-5 days turnaround time based on the staff's workload. Once done, they return the invoice back to the data entry staff. They then add the vendor number to the invoice entry form and sort the invoices based on employee experience. For the step of sorting invoices based on employee experience, it takes approximately 20 minutes for 100 invoices. Next, they enter the invoice information into the SAP system and make the status of the invoice \"parked\". When entering the invoice information into the SAP system, some employees prefer to re-sort the invoices per vendor before entering them, while others sort them based on the invoice amount. After making the status of the invoice \"parked\", they tick the box 'invoice entered' on the invoice entry form. If the invoice is urgent, they put the batch(s) in the High priority outbox. If it is not urgent, they put the batch(s) in the department's outbox. Finally, they validate the invoice and the process ends.

After completing these steps, contact your preferred lender. If you are eligible, you can proceed with the process. However, if you are not eligible, you will need to review the proposed plan.
